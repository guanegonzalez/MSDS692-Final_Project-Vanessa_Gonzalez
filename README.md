## Helping Students Achieve Four-year Graduation Rates by Predicting Computer Science (CS) Program Pain Points in CS Course Sequence.

# Project Overview

Higher Education Institutions struggle in general with the problem of how to increase the graduation rates not just by institution but also by program. Graduation rates are actually reported 2 ways, as the percentage of full-time students who graduate in 4 years and as the percentage of students who graduate in 6 years. These measures are used to rank institutions and are important to maintain or increase enrollment and reputation. In this case we are going to look at the Computer Science program at a Colorado University where not all students that enroll with the Major of Computer Science stay and finish. Some students leave the institution but others change majors while progressing through the coursework. 
We would like to have a better understanding on why and when this happens. We believe that if we are able to predict what students are at risk when taking certain classes then they can be proactive and give additional support to these students to help them succeed and prevent attrition or delay in program completion. 
A variety of factors influence the student decision to leave or change major but we think that there may be a strong relationship between grades obtained in certain courses in a course sequence and four-year graduation rates.

We will try to answer the following questions:

*	What students are at risk at the start of a course to make sure we address their needs and provide support proactively?
* Which are the main points of attrition in the CS course sequence conducive to the loss of students from the CS program or University?

### Data Sets

The data used was extracted from the University Database using IBM Cognos as the tool to query the database. Data from 2008 to 2018 was used. Two data sets were created; One with grades for courses in the math and CS sequences all CS students are required to take for graduation, and another set with the dates when these courses were taken. Both data sets also contained variables describing if the students graduated from CS or if they left the program. A variable was included to describe if the students graduated in four years from CS or if they changed major from the major they changed to.
