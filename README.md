## Helping Students Achieve Four-year Graduation Rates by Predicting Computer Science (CS) Program Pain Points in CS Course Sequence.

# Project Overview

Higher Education Institutions struggle in general with the problem of how to increase the graduation rates not just by institution but also by program. Graduation rates are actually reported 2 ways, as the percentage of full-time students who graduate in 4 years and as the percentage of students who graduate in 6 years. These measures are used to rank institutions and are important to maintain or increase enrollment and reputation. In this case we are going to look at the Computer Science program at a Colorado University where not all students that enroll with the Major of Computer Science stay and finish. Some students leave the institution but others change majors while progressing through the coursework. 
We would like to have a better understanding on why and when this happens. We believe that if we are able to predict what students are at risk when taking certain classes then they can be proactive and give additional support to these students to help them succeed and prevent attrition or delay in program completion. 
A variety of factors influence the student decision to leave or change major but we think that there may be a strong relationship between grades obtained in certain courses in a course sequence and four-year graduation rates.

We will try to answer the following questions:

*	What students are at risk at the start of a course to make sure we address their needs and provide support proactively?
* Which are the main points of attrition in the CS course sequence conducive to the loss of students from the CS program or University?

### Data Sets

The data used was extracted from the University Database using IBM Cognos as the tool to query the database. Data from 2008 to 2018 was used. Two data sets were created; One with grades for courses in the math and CS sequences all CS students are required to take for graduation, and another set with the dates when these courses were taken. Both data sets also contained variables describing if the students graduated from CS or if they left the program. A variable was included to describe if the students graduated in four years from CS or if they changed major from the major they changed to.

### Observations on the Quality of the Data
It was observed in both data sets that to show all the variables needed more than one table from the database was needed. Not all tables resided in the same Cognos packages so further mergers were necessary. Merges were performed utilizing Tableau with the student ID as the item for linking the separate data files. 
Further changes and cleaning were necessary:
* Academic period format had to be changed from year-period to year-month.
* Course names had to be changed to Number of Semester recommended plus course code.
* Double majors had to be cleaned to show just the CS record.
* Several CASE statements in Tableau were used to define depending registration in Spring 18 and Fall 18 if the students were current students or if the students had left the institution.
* CASE statements in Tableau were used to define the student group as CS students if CS had been their original major or their first major.
* Calculations were added in Tableau to define the length between original major date and graduation date.  

After modifications the finished data sets consisted of the fallowing variables:
